# TinyAdventure

Hello and welcome to my Tiny Adventure a little game I made in Java, 
this is very basic and not at all up to AAA standards but I wanted to try and make something.
If your curious I followed along with a video on Youtube by Ryisnow "How to make a Text Adventure in Java"
I highly suggest checking his stuff out and maybe try it yourself as well!

In my game there's a place to put your name though funny enough I never really use this in my game ^^; missed oppertunity I know 
there. I know there are issues in the code and grammer mistakes (trust me my wife has already told me lol) but any suggestions 
or constructive critism is welcomed.

Thank you for playing my game know I'm very new to all this and any help is always welcomed!
